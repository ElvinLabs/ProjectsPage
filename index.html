                    Today there are many electronic household appliances used daily. Due to many highly power consuming appliances, the domestic power consumption is at a stake. In order to reduce the excess usage of power, knowing the household daily power consumption rate is quite important. While every residence has an electric meter, it usually shows the total household energy. Also the meter is placed where it is convenient for the utility people to read. The meter reading will not explain what appliances use more energy and how power is wasted. That puts house owners in a question of how to know individual power consumption of appliances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our project Power Monitor is focused on providing a solution to that problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The device is equipped with a travel plug adapter where user can connect the appliance. An abstract design is shown in Figure 1. The input to the power monitor device will be the voltage that is drawn by the appliance. Some appliances draw a voltage of 0-240V. Since the maximum voltage that can be input to the Intel Galileo Gen 2 board is 5V, an AC voltage divider is used. This is illustrated in Figure 2. The conversions and calculations are done by the Galileo Gen 2 and displayed using a LCD display.

                            Working with manual carts is a major problem in today industry as it is inefficient and not effective. It waste man power uselessly and make accidents while carrying goods manually. So our group aimed to make an automated robot cart which can follow a specific person or a device by its own. Then it can balance and avoid the accidents by hitting somewhere or blocking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So we make a signal emitter which can be used as the remote controller of the cart. We can use the remote for carried by a person or state it in the required place. Then we made signal receivers which is stick in the cart. So the receiver detect its signal and then pass the processed signal to the motor controllers. So they take the action whether to turn left, turn right, go straight or stop. The barrier detecting sensors warn about the barriers in its path and allow it to take a suitable action.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We have to use to boards to signal receiver and emitter. Then proximity sensors, IR sensors, motor controllers and rechargeable batteries to implement our task.

                            Our project aims to implement a home security system using the Galileo board and a web camera. This system uses SMS services to notify the user and e-mails a picture taken from the web cam to the user. More over it activates an alarm.The system uses image processing to detect motion. So that the Gallileo board is used at its one of optimum potential.

                        <p>
                            In his project,  python and open CV image processing libraries are ran on top of the Galileo board to take photos via the web cam, to process them and send E-mails. Algorithms are developed and  coded in python for image processing and sending data. And Linux operating system should is installed on the Gallio board using an SD card.

                            Falling, and the fear of falling, is one of the major health risks that affects the quality of life and the most widespread domestic accident  among older people and people with diseases such as Parkinson’s, threatening their independent living. Falls could be fatal in the case of aged people living alone, in not being treated in time. Even in hospitals, with increasing number of patients, manual monitoring of patients by the hospital staff is not practical. In many cases, physical after-effects and other injuries are direct consequences of these incidents and result in significant medical costs. Hence, given the growing part of the elderly people in the modern society and the growth of patients with mobility issues, importance of designing and developing a fall detector is deemed high. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a solution, our project focuses on developing a wearable device which can fall a detection and alert concerned parties without the involvement of the victim.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to detect a fall, readings from an accelerometer and pulse sensor are used. The 3 axis accelerometer is used to detect proper acceleration of the user in x,y,z axis during different behaviours. The raw voltage readings are scaled and calibrated according to the wearing position on the body. The pulse sensor detects the pulse rate variations of a user and records BPM (beats per minute) values. After testing the device for various movements, threshold values for accelerometer readings and an algorithm for the fall detection was developed. Then, both sets of readings from the accelerometer and the pulse sensor are used according to the algorithm in order to detect a fall. So far, we are generating a buzzer sound as the alarm when a fall occurs. We are hoping to use a WiFi adapter in order to send an alert message to concerned parties.

                <p>
                    <b>Basic Logic</b><br>
    BLIND WALKER is a Galileo Gen2 based embedded system project which supports blind people. The tool will be adjusted on the waist of the user which has three basic ultrasonic sensors
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            A sensor focused straight with the face of the walker.

                        <li>Two sensors angled 60 degrees from the basic sensor focusing the left and right hand side in front.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The tool would initially refer to the sensor in front and details about the path infront(upto 300cm) will be taken into account . If the path is clear a voice output is generated indicating the walker can move forward.</li>
                        <li>In case the sensor focused forward identifies an object within the reach of 30cm(adjustable) the tool invokes a voice output indicating you cannot walk forward anymore and starts refering to the other sensors(focused sideways)</li>
                        <li>The two sensors would measure individually their paths infront and take distance measurements of the paths(upto 300cm).The longest clean path will be indicated to the user with a voice output.</li>

                        <li>The tool would guide the walker in the range of 300cm indicating number of steps he could make safely(in the case an object is detected infront) assuming a step size of 30cm</li>
                        <li>The walker could caliberate the step size to get the walking instructions.</li>

                <p>Notice board is the most traditional, but still widely used means of communicating information to a large group of people. It is a primary component in any institution. With the development of technology, notice board has also evolved up to a certain level. For an instance, there are electronic notice board that displays notices on LCD screens. Still, in most cases, a person has to manually access the notice board in order to display a notice. </p>
                <p>
The aim of this project was to provide a smarter means of displaying notices with the help of embedded systems. Basically, using this notice board, an authorized person can send the message to be displayed as an E-mail and it will be displayed to the public on an LCD screen. An added functionality of the notice board is, only the notices corresponding to the person standing in front of the notice will be displayed. For example, in this case, the notices corresponding to the batch of a university student is displayed. </p>
                <p>
The project is mainly based on Raspberry Pi development board which works with Raspbian Wheezy operating system. Displaying of notices sent as E-mails was done solely using Python. A Python script continuously accesses an E-mail account created for the notice board via Internet, fetches any unread E-mails an stores them in text files corresponding to each batch. Notices are displayed on a web interface.</p>
                <p>
Face recignition was also done using Python, with the help of OpenCv library using Eigenfaces algorithm. An Ultrasonic sensor detects whether a person standing is in front of the notice board and signal the web camera to take a photograph. Then face recognition is carried out using the photograph and the batch of the person is written to a text file. Once the text file is updated notices corresponding to that batch is displayed.</p>
