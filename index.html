                    Today there are many electronic household appliances used daily. Due to many highly power consuming appliances, the domestic power consumption is at a stake. In order to reduce the excess usage of power, knowing the household daily power consumption rate is quite important. While every residence has an electric meter, it usually shows the total household energy. Also the meter is placed where it is convenient for the utility people to read. The meter reading will not explain what appliances use more energy and how power is wasted. That puts house owners in a question of how to know individual power consumption of appliances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our project Power Monitor is focused on providing a solution to that problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The device is equipped with a travel plug adapter where user can connect the appliance. An abstract design is shown in Figure 1. The input to the power monitor device will be the voltage that is drawn by the appliance. Some appliances draw a voltage of 0-240V. Since the maximum voltage that can be input to the Intel Galileo Gen 2 board is 5V, an AC voltage divider is used. This is illustrated in Figure 2. The conversions and calculations are done by the Galileo Gen 2 and displayed using a LCD display.

                            Working with manual carts is a major problem in today industry as it is inefficient and not effective. It waste man power uselessly and make accidents while carrying goods manually. So our group aimed to make an automated robot cart which can follow a specific person or a device by its own. Then it can balance and avoid the accidents by hitting somewhere or blocking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So we make a signal emitter which can be used as the remote controller of the cart. We can use the remote for carried by a person or state it in the required place. Then we made signal receivers which is stick in the cart. So the receiver detect its signal and then pass the processed signal to the motor controllers. So they take the action whether to turn left, turn right, go straight or stop. The barrier detecting sensors warn about the barriers in its path and allow it to take a suitable action.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We have to use to boards to signal receiver and emitter. Then proximity sensors, IR sensors, motor controllers and rechargeable batteries to implement our task.

                            Our project aims to implement a home security system using the Galileo board and a web camera. This system uses SMS services to notify the user and e-mails a picture taken from the web cam to the user. More over it activates an alarm.The system uses image processing to detect motion. So that the Gallileo board is used at its one of optimum potential.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In his project,  python and open CV image processing libraries are ran on top of the Galileo board to take photos via the web cam, to process them and send E-mails. Algorithms are developed and  coded in python for image processing and sending data. And Linux operating system should is installed on the Gallio board using an SD card.

                            Falling, and the fear of falling, is one of the major health risks that affects the quality of life and the most widespread domestic accident  among older people and people with diseases such as Parkinson’s, threatening their independent living. Falls could be fatal in the case of aged people living alone, in not being treated in time. Even in hospitals, with increasing number of patients, manual monitoring of patients by the hospital staff is not practical. In many cases, physical after-effects and other injuries are direct consequences of these incidents and result in significant medical costs. Hence, given the growing part of the elderly people in the modern society and the growth of patients with mobility issues, importance of designing and developing a fall detector is deemed high. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a solution, our project focuses on developing a wearable device which can fall a detection and alert concerned parties without the involvement of the victim.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to detect a fall, readings from an accelerometer and pulse sensor are used. The 3 axis accelerometer is used to detect proper acceleration of the user in x,y,z axis during different behaviours. The raw voltage readings are scaled and calibrated according to the wearing position on the body. The pulse sensor detects the pulse rate variations of a user and records BPM (beats per minute) values. After testing the device for various movements, threshold values for accelerometer readings and an algorithm for the fall detection was developed. Then, both sets of readings from the accelerometer and the pulse sensor are used according to the algorithm in order to detect a fall. So far, we are generating a buzzer sound as the alarm when a fall occurs. We are hoping to use a WiFi adapter in order to send an alert message to concerned parties.

                <p>
                    <b>Basic Logic</b><br>
    BLIND WALKER is a Galileo Gen2 based embedded system project which supports blind people. The tool will be adjusted on the waist of the user which has three basic ultrasonic sensors
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            A sensor focused straight with the face of the walker.
                        </li>
                        <li>Two sensors angled 60 degrees from the basic sensor focusing the left and right hand side in front.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The tool would initially refer to the sensor in front and details about the path infront(upto 300cm) will be taken into account . If the path is clear a voice output is generated indicating the walker can move forward.</li>
                        <li>In case the sensor focused forward identifies an object within the reach of 30cm(adjustable) the tool invokes a voice output indicating you cannot walk forward anymore and starts refering to the other sensors(focused sideways)</li>
                        <li>The two sensors would measure individually their paths infront and take distance measurements of the paths(upto 300cm).The longest clean path will be indicated to the user with a voice output.</li>

                <p>Notice board is the most traditional, but still widely used means of communicating information to a large group of people. It is a primary component in any institution. With the development of technology, notice board has also evolved up to a certain level. For an instance, there are electronic notice board that displays notices on LCD screens. Still, in most cases, a person has to manually access the notice board in order to display a notice. </p>
                <p>
The aim of this project was to provide a smarter means of displaying notices with the help of embedded systems. Basically, using this notice board, an authorized person can send the message to be displayed as an E-mail and it will be displayed to the public on an LCD screen. An added functionality of the notice board is, only the notices corresponding to the person standing in front of the notice will be displayed. For example, in this case, the notices corresponding to the batch of a university student is displayed. </p>
                <p>
The project is mainly based on Raspberry Pi development board which works with Raspbian Wheezy operating system. Displaying of notices sent as E-mails was done solely using Python. A Python script continuously accesses an E-mail account created for the notice board via Internet, fetches any unread E-mails an stores them in text files corresponding to each batch. Notices are displayed on a web interface.</p>
                <p>
Face recignition was also done using Python, with the help of OpenCv library using Eigenfaces algorithm. An Ultrasonic sensor detects whether a person standing is in front of the notice board and signal the web camera to take a photograph. Then face recognition is carried out using the photograph and the batch of the person is written to a text file. Once the text file is updated notices corresponding to that batch is displayed.</p>

Stock Refill Notifier is a sms based system that alerts the user about the different stock levels. Because of the unknown stock levels, checking the usage of the stocks and maintaining the stocks have become a major problem. Most of the projects available for stock level indication gives the indication whether the stock levels are empty or full. So the focus of the Stock Refill Notifier is to recognize whether the stock is empty for a specified percentage (ex. 70%) and provide a better recognition of the stock levels to the user.
                </p>
                <p>
Detecting the available space in the rack is done by image processing using Arduino with OpenCV and Python. As the OS Yocto Linux has been used. After processing the image, if the space available is 70% or higher, the system generates an alert message (sms) and sends it to the user.
                </p>
                <p>
When considering the general purpose use of the system, the stock refilling notifier system is suitable for any kind of a stock. This system can be used at companies, offices and even in home or schools for monitoring various stocks and storages.

                <p>Aim of this project is develop a public transportation detail system. When we use public transports, sometimes we have to face some problems. Where is the bus now? How many passengers are there? Can I take a seat? As well as some times passengers have no idea now where is the bus? How long to get off from the bus? These are common problems people faced when they use public transportation. To avoid these problems sometimes we have no proper way. Our project is small attempt to solve above problems and make the clients travel comfortable.
                </p>
                <p>Here I briefly explain, how we provide services to clients. If waiting person for the bus needs to know, now where is the bus, he should send sms to provided specific mobile number, then he get replies the current location of the bus and nearest town. Acknowledge the passengers about current location of the bus, show location in led/lcd display. We hope to develop small web page to show the passenger details of the bus. Using this web page clients can get the idea about how many passengers are there, location of the bus and number of empty seats.
                </p>
                <p>The project basically based on Galileo Gen 2 board with a GSM shield. GSM shield is used to send & receive sms. To display the location in the bus lcd/led display will be used. To find the location of the  bus, we use dialog ideamart application.

                <p>As the population increases, the demand for water increases. Outdoor water is very limited. Homeowners who have irrigation systems often apply too much water to plants too frequently. Then water is wasting. But from our system, we are watering when plants need water. It is very useful to protect water.
                </p>
                <p> Today people are very busy. Then they do not have enough time to water plants every day. If they have this kind of system, it will be very useful.
                </p>
                <p>Our project is to make an automatic watering system using Arduino, soil humidity sensor and a water pump. Humidity sensor takes constant readings of the soil moisture and transfers to Arduino. The system amount of moisture needed simply turning the potentiometer. Then the system opens and closes the water valve of the pump if the soil is below your specified level of moisture. We have implemented a web server. Arduino board is connected to the internet and it sends data to the server as a GET request. Users have accounts in our website and they can see those updated data(moisture level, watering times..etc). Yahoo weather API is used for check whether it is raining or not.

                <p>We give authority to limit multiple users to publish Notices in this notice Board. Also we considered that Notices through an online forum is not a fast way of transferring Notices to people. As an example this kind of notice board can be put up in the Ground floor of the CE Building. If a Staff member wants to pass a Urgent notice to students then he/she can easily put the notice while in the home.

To achieve those, embedded systems and wireless technology can be used together while embedded systems are capable of controlling the devices and wireless technologies to control them remotely.  Most of the time they use WIFI in their experiments as the robustness of it. Also there are plenty of other useful wireless technologies that can be used like GSM (SMS and calls, IR , etc...).

                <p>The proposed system is designed to solve this problem. Gestures of fingers of a user of this glove will be converted into synthesized speech to convey an audible message to others, for example in a critical communication with doctors. The glove is internally equipped with multiple flex sensors that are made up of “bend-sensitive resistance elements”. Those flex sensors are design by us because of the flex sensors are more expensive.
                </p>
                <p>We use LED and LDR for creating our own flex sensors. For each specific gesture, internal flex sensors produce a proportional change in resistance of various elements. The processing of this information sends a unique set of signals to the Intel Galileo Gen 2 board and it process the signals and play a saved wave file through USB sound card.

                <p>This project aims at developing a universal hand gesture-recognition glove. Generally, products of this category are application-specific. However, this will be a universal product with the potential of wide range of applications. Many different hand gestures will be identified using the data captured by the sensors of the glove and these data will be processed according to the application. 
                </p>
                <p>Applications of this glove include gaming, virtual reality, robotics, surgeries, sign language recognition and much more. Differently abled people (specifically, people with lesser number of fingers) will also be able to use this instrument easily. 
                </p>
                <p>For this project, we have developed a glove that captures the basic hand movements, such as waving and flexing fingers. Using data related to these movements, we can illustrate certain areas where this can be useful. Here, we have used our glove as a remote control to drive a small robot and as a computer mouse. To capture these movements we used a 2-axis accelerometer and two flex sensors. Using the accelerometer, we collected data representing the movements of the hand in a 2D plane and using the two flex sensors the data regarding the flexing of the middle finger and the thumb are collected. These data are then sent to the Intel Galileo gen2 board for processing. After the required information is obtained, it is sent to the destined device in a serial form. When using as a remote control, it is sent to an Arduino board of the robot, and when used as a mouse, to a serial port of the computer.
